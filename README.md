Sunrise Hues: Build sunrises for Philips Hue bulbs
============


[Philips Hue](http://www.meethue.com) lights are a great technology: wireless 
programmable LED light bulbs. 
I use them to simulate sunrise at an earlier time than the sun actually rises. 
This gives me a stimulus to awaken that is gentler than a radio or buzzer.

There are many applications for controlling Hue bulbs, but none of them 
do exactly what I want, so I decided to build my own app. Philips provides
a device that joins your home's wifi and which contains a little tiny 
web server. I can control my lights via the [REST api](http://www.developers.meethue.com/). 

This app is specialized to just build sunrises and install them as a schedule
in my bulbs. The UI lets you design a gradient, try each color out on the lights,
and view an accelerated in-browser animated preview.

Right now the app has hardcoded Philips configuration:
* assumes the bridge is at 10.0.0.3
* assumes you are authenticated as user `newdeveloper`
* assumes that you have 3 lights
If you need to change these settings, edit `app/scripts/services/hue-service.js`

Next steps:

1. Run an accelerated up preview of the sunrise on the actual bulbs

2. Install the schedule in the bulbs

3. Allow configuration of the hue connection
