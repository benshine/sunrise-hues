I can control my lights via the [REST api](http://www.developers.meethue.com/). \r\n\r\nThis app is specialized to just build sunrises and install them as a schedule\r\nin my bulbs. The UI lets you design a gradient, try each color out on the lights,\r\nand view an accelerated in-browser animated preview.\r\n\r\nRight now the app has hardcoded Philips configuration:\r\n* assumes the bridge is at 10.0.0.3\r\n* assumes you are authenticated as user `newdeveloper`\r\n* assumes that you have 3 lights\r\nIf you need to change these settings, edit `app/scripts/services/hue-service.js`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
